Within this folder are the final predictions for im2txt and neuraltalk2. One set of jsons contains only the raw predictions while the other set of jsons contains the raw predictions with their bleu scores. The sets of predictions with the best average bleu scores were calculated with the script in `data/processing-code/python/bleu-score-choosing` and these prediction jsons were used in the mechanical turk survey.
