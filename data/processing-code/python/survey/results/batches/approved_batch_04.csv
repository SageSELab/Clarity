I can clearly see it at the top of the screenshot.","The description could demonstrate how exactly to use the slider to adjust the parental controls (e.x. use your mouse, curser, or remote and pick the rating level for each of the following types of content).","The description isn't proper English, so it was incredibly hard to interpret and understand. Also, I do not think the icon in the center of the screen is the focal point of the photo, so it could say something like, ""users can choose their location at the top left of the screen.""","The description could discuss how to change the brightness of the phone.

The screenshot doesn't really stand alone without the description, but the description is so vague that it may be hard to put two and two together.","I think that the description should say that there is a link that one could click in order to see the two columns, which may be better for users to visualize and understand.","First, the sentence of the description should be complete, as it trails off in the middle of the sentence. The description could also say what exactly the screen is about- that it is about home decor, furniture, and what is important in order to decorate a house.","The sentence could be finished, first of all.

Other than this, I think it is a fairly accurate description.","The description first could be a complete sentence. Second, the description could talk about how users can provide feedback to the app, which is what the focal point of the screenshot looks to be.","There is no link at the top left corner of the page, which may be very confusing. I also do not see a menu in the given page, which calls for an inaccurate description.","I don't think there is anything INACCURATE about the screenshot, as everything the user is trying to say is technically true.","The screenshot clearly states how to change the brightness of the phone. There is no place to input an email address. If I were reading the description as a user, I would be very confused.","I think the description does not mention exact location. It mentions that users can select their country. However, if they select something like ""China"" or the ""U.S.A."" this can get a little vague, since they are very large areas.","There is no prompt to show how the user can change the picture. In fact, it shows a charge screen, so the user really may have to make the connection that they have the option to customize their screen.","I do not see two columns in the photo, so this might be very confusing to readers or users.","First, I do not see any link or button.
