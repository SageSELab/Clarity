com.everbum.lnl () () () () () () () () () () (Baby Care Log Help) () () (  [[conf]] Configuration  Start using the app by configuring it! Setting the date of birth is important to aid the navigation and the different computations. You can do this from Prefrences/Baby settings or by tapping the main page left icon and going directly to Baby settings. You can also introduce here your baby's picture by pressing the picture square, so you have your baby's image as the icon in the app title bar.  Main page  Start using the app by pressing one of the action buttons bellow the title, in the page top bar. Below there is the date navigator, the next and previous day buttons and, on the right, the calendar allowing you to pick any date. Bellow the navigator, there is a list with all the actions recorded in the active day: time, title and description.  Common actions functionality For each action, you can set the date and time, by tapping the blue rectangles from the top of the page: first rectangle for time, and second for date. Also, you can add notes (e.g. Took the vitamin, but spat out most of it). Two buttons are placed on the bottom of the page: Cancel - to abort current action and Save & Exit - to add the action and go back to main page. Each action is optimized to work both vertically and horizontally. For Nursing and Sleep actions, changing page orientation is not possible.  Persistence functionality For actions involving a timer (sleep and breast feeding), a special button exists, Exit & Continue, allowing you to leave the action page or even the app while the counter goes on. The action button flashes to signal a persistent action.  Edit & Delete an action By long pressing an item from the daily list (main page), you can choose to edit or delete an existing recorded action.  Actions functionality   [[bottle]] Bottle feeding  You can change the measuring unit between oz and ml. After change, the max and current values will be changed accordingly. After Mom milk is checked, you can slide the bar to select a value between 0 and maximum. Also, you can change the max value by tapping the blue box on the right. The same functionality for Formula milk.   [[nurse]] Breast feeding  On top, after date and time, you have an info box about the last used breast. It indicates the breast you used in the previous action, not now. Two big blue boxes come next, one marked left and one right. By tapping the play button accordingly you'll start recording the feeding time, and the box becomes green. Tapping play on the other box automatically stops the previous one. Also, you can manually change the time by tapping in the blue box, but outside the play/pause button. The button bellow is a general stop, stopping both timers.   [[diaper]] Changing diapers  You can select if there was a pee or not, if there was a poop or not, and three degrees of pooping.   [[sleep]] Sleeping  Like in Breast feeding you have a big blue box for counting the sleeping time. The sleeping time can also be changed manually.   [[med]] Take medicine  By using the Medicine selector you can choose which medicine to record. Using the button Edit medicine list, you can add, modify or delete every medicine to/from the list. Each line is a medicine.   [[bath]] Bath time!  Nothing specific here.   [[gener]] Generic action  You can introduce here new actions you find useful to track in relation to your baby. As in Take medicine, you have a selector to see an action name, and a button Edit title list to manage the generic actions list.   [[solid]] Solid food  Very similar in functionality with "Take medicine" action. You can also rate how much the baby likes a food.   [[pump]] Breast pumping  It allows you to record the quantity of breast milk you pumped. There are separate measurements for each breast. Also, you can set the last breast you pumped. You can change the measuring unit between oz and ml.    [[meas]] Measuring  You are able now to measure and check the progress for length, weight and head circumference of your baby. You can change the measuring unit between cm/kg and inches/pounds.     [[stat]] Statistics  You can follow your baby's progress by going to the statistics, the first button after the action ones in the action bar. You can choose between seven types of statistics: daily digest, bottle progress, diapers usage, breast feeding progress, breast pumping progress, sleep progress and last event (telling you how much time has lapsed since the last action in each category). In daily digest page, you can go to a specific day by long tapping the corresponding list element. In the last action page, you will see just the actions you selected to be used in actions bar. In bottle progress page, you have the graph of quantities in magenta and a graph of average values in gray.    [[gstat]] Growth Statistics  Similar with statistics.  Shacking gesture You can configure a shortcut for the last event statistics, accessible by shacking the phone/tablet.  App Help Each page has a question mark icon on the right of the title bar. When you first tap it you'll have to choose between local help and online help. After that, it always will open the one you first selected. If you want to change the selection, long tap the question mark icon.  Action bar customization By long tapping an action in the action bar, you can change the visibility and place for each action.  Export feature You can also export data. From the main window, you can export the current day by tapping the export button from the title. In the statistics window you will also find an export button for daily digest and for bottle progress.  Last event widget You have the possibility to add this important information to your main page. You can have maximum 6 last actions. They will appear in the same order as in the action bar.  Sync functionality You can auto synchronize (via net) the log between many devices. The action can be activated from the drawer.    [[alert]] Alerts & Notifications  There is the possibility to add, for an action, four types of notifications or alerts: fixed time, since last action, action count today, action count overall. For each event you can add sound, flash signals or vibrations.) () () (Close)

For example, we may collect your personal and other information when you request or acquire a product or service from us, provide a service or product to us, apply for employment with us or communicate with us via our website, by e-mail, telephone or in writing. Wherever reasonable and practicable, we collect personal information from the individual to whom the information relates. If you provide personal information about someone other than yourself, you agree that you have that person’s consent to provide the information for the purpose for which you provide it to us.

The Google Information is anonymised and allhomes does not merge it with any personally-identifiable information. You can opt out of the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting feature by clicking this link: opt out  We will only collect your sensitive information if you have consented to us doing so – for example, as part of information collected about directors and employees for company and human resource management purposes; or where required or permitted by law.

We usually collect personal and other information from:  *    face-to-face meetings, interviews and telephone calls; *    business cards; *    electronic communications – for example, e-mails and attachments; forms filled out by people, including as part of acquiring a product or service from us; *    third parties – for example, from listing agents, State and Territory Governments, recruitment agencies and your representatives or agents, and, in the case of the Google Information, from Google (see above under ' What types of personal and other information do we collect and hold?'); and *    our website, including if you use it to contact us.  Why do we collect personal and other information? We collect the personal and other information (including the Google Information): to enable us to publish residential and commercial property listings information via our website and mobile apps; necessary for us to provide you with the products and services you have requested from us; for marketing purposes and to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you; to improve the products and services we provide; and to enable us to conduct our business, including meeting our legal and regulatory obligations. If you do not provide your personal information, we may not be able to supply the requested product or service, employ you or otherwise deal with you.  How we deal with unsolicited personal information? If we receive personal information about you that we have not requested, and we determine that we could not have lawfully collected that information under the APPs had we asked for it, we will destroy or de-identify the information if it is lawful and reasonable to do so.  Do you have to disclose your identity when dealing with us? Where lawful and practicable, we will give you the option of interacting with us anonymously or using a pseudonym.  Use of personal and other information: We only use your personal and other information for the purpose for which it was provided to us, for related purposes or as required or permitted by law. Such purposes include:  *    in the ordinary course of conducting our business. For example, publishing residential and commercial property listings information via our website and mobile apps, supplying or acquiring products and services, responding to your enquiries and feedback, and providing information about our events, news, publications and products and services that may be of interest to you; *    market research and product and service development, so that we are able to better understand our customers’ needs and tailor our future products and services accordingly; *    performing general administration, reporting and management functions. For example, invoicing and account management, payment processing, risk management, training, quality assurance and managing suppliers; *    employment-related purposes, such as recruiting and providing services to staff; *    as part of a sale (or proposed sale) of all or part of our business, or a sale (or proposed sale) of shares in allhomes; and *    other purposes related to or in connection with our business, including meeting our legal and contractual obligations to third parties and for internal corporate governance purposes.  Disclosure of personal and other information: We may disclose, and you consent to us disclosing, your personal and other information to third parties:  *    to the extent that a website user collects residential and commercial property listings information from our website; *    engaged by us to provide products or services, or to undertake functions or activities, on our behalf. For example, processing payment information, managing databases, marketing, research and advertising; *    that are authorised by you to receive information we hold; *    that are our business partners, joint venturers, partners or agents; *    as part of a sale (or proposed sale) of all or part of our business, or a sale (or proposed sale) of shares in allhomes. For example, we may disclose information to our external advisers, to potential and actual bidders and to their external advisors; *    such as our external advisers, and government agencies. For example, where disclosure is reasonably required to obtain advice, prepare legal proceedings or investigate suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct; or *    as required or permitted by law.  We may disclose, and you consent to us disclosing, your personal and other information to any of our related bodies corporate whether located in Australia or overseas. If we disclose your personal information to a related body corporate, your information will be collected, stored, used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the APPs.  Marketing use and disclosure: We may use and disclose your personal and other information (other than sensitive information) to provide you with information about our products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. You may opt out at any time if you do not, or no longer, wish to receive marketing and promotional material. You may do this by: contacting us via e-mail or in writing at the address below and requesting that we no longer send you marketing or promotional material; or where applicable, clicking the "Unsubscribe" button.  Use or disclosure of sensitive information: We will only use or disclose your sensitive information for the purpose for which it was initially collected or for a directly related purpose, as required or permitted by law, or where you consent to the use or disclosure.  Disclosure of personal and other information overseas: From May 2014, allhomes will have disaster recovery support including use of servers physically located in a data centre in Hong Kong. Information that allhomes collects is backed up to, stored on, and retrieved from, those servers.  Also, allhomes’ electronic mail capability is provided by Google, and email is stored on Google’s servers. Google has data centres in the United States, Finland, Belgium, Taiwan, Singapore, and Ireland. Any personal or other information contained in email will be stored in a data centre in one or more of those countries.  Any overseas disclosure does not affect our commitment to safeguarding your personal or other information. Where reasonable in the circumstances, our contracts with overseas recipients oblige them to comply with the APPs and the Act. However, you acknowledge that, in agreeing to the disclosure of your information to overseas recipients, we will no longer be required to take reasonable steps to ensure overseas recipients’ compliance with the APPs in relation to your information and we will not be liable to you for any breach of the APPs by those overseas recipients. On this basis, you consent to such disclosure.  How is my personal and other information kept secure? We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. Such steps include: physical security over paper-based and electronic data storage and premises; computer and network security measures, including use of firewalls, password access and secure servers; restricting access to your personal information to employees and those acting on our behalf who are authorised and on a 'need to know' basis; retaining your personal information for no longer than it is reasonably required, unless we are required by law to retain it for longer; and entering into confidentiality agreements with staff and third parties.  Allhomes uses a hosting provider for the storage of its information. The hosting provider uses a primary server room in Canberra and a secondary server room in Sydney. From May 2014, allhomes’ hosting provider’s primary server room will be in Sydney and its secondary server room will be in Hong Kong. Secure access to physical servers is controlled by allhomes’ hosting provider. Access to the information stored on the servers is protected by username/password authentication authorisation schemes.  Data transmissions between allhomes’ servers and its hosting provider’s servers is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") security mechanisms.  Allhomes uses network vulnerability testers to ensure the security of its data. Allhomes also uses monitoring devices within its network infrastructure to notify of incursion or attempted incursion.  Where we no longer require your personal information, including where we are no longer required by law to keep records relating to you, we will ensure that it is de-identified or destroyed.  Data quality: We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on you to advise us of any changes or corrections to the information we hold about you. If you consider that the information we hold about you is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, or if your information has changed, please let us know as soon as possible.  Access: You may request access to the personal information we hold about you by contacting us. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time. We will provide you with access to the information we hold about you unless otherwise permitted or required by law. If we deny you access to the information, we will notify you of the basis for the denial unless an exception applies. Where reasonable and practicable, we will provide access to the information we hold about you in the manner you request. No fee applies for requesting access to information we hold about you. However, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee where we do provide access.  Information we hold about current residential and commercial property listings is freely available via our website and mobile apps.  Correction: If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or not current, you may request that we update or correct your information by contacting us.

appinventor.ai_homestudioapp.angelsexist () () () (KNOW YOUR ANGELS) () () () () () (What is Your Guardian Angel’s Name?) () ( Everyone has a guardian angel but you have to find out who it is so you can call upon him or her when you need them.Your guardian angel is here to guide and protect you. The inner promptings you receive are often your angel leading you to where you should be going in life. However, it’s up to you to choose whether or not to listen to what he or she is saying. Your guardian angel has a name so that you can call upon him or her at any time. If you don’t already know what your guardian angel’s name is, there’s a very simple way to find that information out.  All you need to do is set aside a few minutes and find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed.  Sit in a comfortable seat where you can sit up straight and place your feet flat on the floor. Make sure to take off anything that binds you, including jewelry, shoes, or a tight belt. Just sit there a few minutes and relax. Then take a nice deep breath, and let it out like a sigh of relief. As you inhale, imagine yourself taking in everything that you want. As you exhale, imagine yourself letting go of anything that you don’t want. Now begin to count just your inhales. When you reach the number twenty, simply ask your guardian angel his or her name. Then quiet your thoughts and wait for an answer. Be patient and know that your response is coming. The answer may come as a thought, a picture, a feeling, or even an audible voice. Be open to accept whatever is given to you. If at first you don’t receive anything, ask your guardian angel to speak louder so that you can hear him or her. The most common way to receive an answer is as a thought, so if a name just pops in your head, don’t think you are making it up. In this case, your guardian angel is speaking to you telepathically, so make sure to accept whatever you are you are receiving. The key is to simply listen for the first name that comes to you. Your guardian angel is yours alone so don’t try to look it up to see if there is such an angel. So if the name seems funny to you, accept it anyway. If you have doubts about what you have received, ask your angel to confirm the name by giving you signs during the next few days with his or her name in it. For example, if you were given the name Rebecca, and start seeing that name on billboards, catalogs, nametags, etc., know that you have truly received the correct name. Your guardian angel wants you to know his or her name and will gladly give you the confirmation you need!Remember, all you have to do is ask, and then wait for a reply. It’s that simple. Be open to receive and you will!)

() () () (Instruction) () (I like to use my oven as an "incubator", which hastens the proofing of the dough. I simply turn my oven to WARM for a few minutes, then shut it off. Dissolve the yeast in warm water and the sugar until it foams (5-10 minutes). In the meantime, melt the butter in the microwave, then the milk. Combine and allow to cool to about 110F. (You could use a saucepan, but the microwave is much easier for me-- I use 25 second increments.) Dump the milk and yeast mixture into the mixing bowl. Add about 2-1/2 cups flour and mix with the dough hook. (Or, beat by hand). Mix for about a minute. With the mixer still going, add the remaining flour, a bit at a time and mix for another couple of minutes, or until the dough starts to clean the sides of the bowl. (I used 3 cups of flour, total). Knead on low speed for about 2 more minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic – the dough will still be slightly sticky to the touch. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to grease the top. Cover the dough with a clean, dry dish towel, (or plastic wrap) and let it rise in a warm place, free from draft (or in the incubated oven), for about 20 minutes. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and gently shape into a square. Divide into 9 or 12 pieces. I shape each roll by pulling them into a more circular shape then grab corners to the center and twist. Place the ball on a lightly floured surface, twist side down and gently grab and roll into a round ball. You can also make 27 or 24 small balls and make "clover leaf rolls". You then place3 mini dough balls into a greased muffin cup. Cover the rolls with the dish towel, and let the dough rise for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven for 425ºF. Bake for about 12 minutes or until the rolls are golden brown. Remove from pans immediately, and brush with 2 Tablespoons melted butter, immediately. Cool on a wire rack, and you can eat these within just a few minutes. The texture of these rolls are fluffy and this is now my "go to" recipe for bread rolls.)

With the right arrangement and seating styles you can turn a drab and quiet living area into a buzzing den of conversation. Look for couches that reflect your personal style, but also offer comfortable seating. Be wary of seating that is too soft, as this will make it hard for people to sit forward and engage with others. On the other hand, finding a chair, chaise or recliner in which to hunker down for movie or TV viewing is perfectly reasonable – just make sure that it isn't your main item of living room furniture. A couch that is too firm will not be comfortable for long conversations. Often the best choice is something cushiony but supportive.) (     Popular living room seating includes couches and sectional sofas, chaise lounges, accent seating, recliners, armchairs and loveseats.) (Media Furniture) (     Today's media furniture needs to do more than just house your TV and stereo. It is just as important that your entertainment armoire, media cabinet, entertainment center or Audio-Video rack hold CDs, DVDs, and even old videotapes, while matching or coordinating with the existing home furniture. Your ultimate decision will depend in large part on what fits the space, although personal preference is always important.) (Living Room Accessories) (     Coffee tables, end tables, side tables, ottomans and decorative chests are just a few of the larger, more impressive pieces of living room furniture accessories available. Smaller living room accessories help to add homey touches that make a house a home. Such items include candleholders, picture frames, artwork, and flower vases among many others.) ()

com.rechild.advancedtaskkiller () () () () () () () () (Advanced Task Killer Free) () () () (Advanced Task Killer Free v2.2.1 build 216 Copyright(C) 2009, Rechild What is new: -v2.2.1B216 resize widget  -v2.2.0B215 remove 'menu'and 'check' button apply new UI  -v2.1.3B213 Roll back to old widget size  -v2.1.2B212 Fix "cannot get process issue" for Android 5.0 and later version Fix widget icon. Change UI to old version.  *New feature*  1. What is the 'Check' button? This is used to check if your phone has any issues. Since this is a new feature, we don't have many checking items yet. You can use it to check if your phone has any apps pushing ads.  *General help*  1. How to use it (for new users to quick start)? It is pretty simple. Open this tool and take a look at the running applications list? Uncheck some apps you don't want to kill (such as Advanced Task Killer and some system apps) Tap the button 'Kill selected apps', it will kill all applications checked.  2. How to use it (for new users to do more)? If you don't want to kill any application, you can tap it on the running applications list. Then it's checking box will turn to gray.      3. Why there are programs running that I haven't used or even opened? Some applications will start up once you turn on your phone or be invoked by some events.  4. What is ignore list/ignore? Ignore list is for you to ignore some applications you don't want to kill. If you long press on the application listed on the main screen of ATK, the menu will pop up, then you can select 'Ignore', the application would be moved to ignore list. When you tap 'Kill selected apps', it won't be killed any more.  5. What is default action for long press You can set your default action for long press and click on the settings. The system default action for long press is pop-menu. That means you when you long press on the application(displays on the running applications list), a pop-menu would shows up. For example, if you want to switch to the application after you long press on it, you can set the default action of long press to 'Switch to'.   6. What is Auto-Kill We don't suggest people use auto kill. Abusing auto kill might consume more resources. If you want to kill apps automatically you need to choose one of auto-kill level 1. Safe: Only kill the apps aren't running but still consume memory. 2. Aggressive: Kill the apps running background and apps aren't running. 3. Crazy: All apps except for apps you are using with. You should be able to see Auto Kill information shows on the title, like 'Auto-Kill: 12:20'. That means auto kill will start at 12:20, you can also change the frequency to impact the auto kill start time. If you encounter any issues in security level low, you can kill them one by one to find out which one cuase these issues, then you can uncheck or ignore it.  7. What is Security Level We suggest people keep it as 'High'. Changing security level might cause some issues, if you don't know your phone well.  You can set it to low to show more apps, but you need know more about the apps to decide which one you need to ignore.   8. Why I have some green items on running list? Those apps are services and front apps. They cannot be killed directly in Android 2.2 and later version. You can Long Press on it and choose 'Force Stop' on the menu to force stop them. For Android 2.2 users, we suggest you go to settings to ignore them if they don't consume resources very much. )

We do not collect personal information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or credit card numbers) about you, except when you specifically provide the information on a voluntary basis. Your personal information may be collected as you:  Become a registered user of flashseats.com;  Bid on, or purchase Right(s) (Rights is defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use)  Sign-up or subscribe for products or services that we may periodically make available; or  Receive Right(s) transferred to you from one of our account holders. (You will be notified if your personal information is collected in this manner by receipt of a transfer email from one of our account holders.)   We use your personally identifiable information for several purposes:  1. Transactional Communications  If you are bidding for or selling Right(s) the Company utilizes your personal information to communicate with you regarding the status of your bid or auction.  If you have posted a request to purchase Right(s) (an ask), the Company utilizes your personal information to notify you of responses to your ask.  If you are purchasing Right(s), the Company utilizes your personal information to complete the purchase transaction and to communicate with you about your ticket order, to provide you with instructions on how to use and/or access your electronic ticket to gain admission to an event or venue or other inquiry.  Whenever you purchase Right(s) we may be required to share your personal information with a third-party credit card processor to facilitate completion of your transaction. The credit card processor may share the same information with your credit card issuer in connection with gathering data related to use of their cards, rewards programs or other purposes. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing the use of your credit cards.  When you purchase Right(s), we may be contractually required to provide your personal information to the Event Host so that they may communicate with you about the event you are going to attend. Under those circumstances, we cannot offer you the option to opt-out from having your information passed to the Event Host. Event Hosts are not subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, which means that they may use your personal information for purposes other than contacting you about the event you are going to attend, unless you contact them and request otherwise. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing events and venues prior to purchasing Right(s).  Whenever you transfer an account balance to your bank account we may be required to share your personal information with a third-party financial processor to facilitate completion of your transaction. The processor may share the same information with your bank in connection with the transaction. You are urged to read and become familiar with the privacy policies governing the bank accounts to which you transfer funds using our system.  Whenever you transfer an account balance to an Event Host we may be required to share your personal information with that Event Host to ensure the proper allocation of your account balance to the Event Hosts accounting system.      We may occasionally contact you, typically by email, to notify you of information that might affect your event experience, or to notify you of event cancellations or errors in your order.       2. Service/Account Communications      We may contact you regarding the availability of Right(s) similar to those you have purchased in the past, or the current selling prices of Right(s) similar to those you hold. We may also send you communications regarding the availability or selling prices of Right(s) according to preferences you set in your user profile. If you are not interested in receiving informational communications from us, you can unsubscribe at any time by altering your email preferences in your user profile or by emailing unsubscribe@flashseats.com from the email address used to identify your account with the word Unsubscribe Informational in the subject line.       3. Informational Communications      We may contact you regarding the status of your account, your registration information, support issues regarding our service, and changes to our service or the terms under which it is offered.       4. Promotional Communications      We may contact you regarding special promotions related to our service, or to events or venues. If you are not interested in receiving promotional communications from us, you can unsubscribe at any time by altering your email preferences in your user profile or by emailing unsubscribe@flashseats.com from the email address used to identify your account with the word Unsubscribe Promotional in the subject line.       5. Marketing Communications      We may contact you regarding offerings of future events, products or services that may be of interest to you. If you are not interested in receiving marketing communications or advertisements from us, you can unsubscribe at any time by altering your email preferences in your user profile or by emailing us at unsubscribe@flashseats.com from the email address used to identify your account with the word Unsubscribe Marketing in the subject line.        Additionally, we may share your personally identifiable information in the following circumstances:       We may disclose your personally identifiable information when required by law. Specifically, we may disclose this information to unrelated parties in special cases when we have reason to believe that our disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a person or persons who may be causing injury to, or interference with, the rights or property of the Company (including our website), computer users accessing our website, or any third party. In addition, we may disclose information about individuals who access our website to law enforcement agencies, judicial or government authorities or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes.       In the event that Flash Seats goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, your and other users personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, your personal information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given the option to continue sharing the information consistent with our notification of changes section. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Flash Seats to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including the website) for any purposes, without limitation. Flash Seats specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from this website to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information.       If you are a registered user of flashseats.com, we may retain your information as long as you maintain your registered status. If you purchase tickets or other merchandise using a credit card, we will retain your credit card information for a length of time necessary to process any future transactions related to your purchases, including refunds and charge backs.   Childrens Privacy  Our sites comply with the terms of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act. Under this Act, no website operator is permitted to require, as a condition to participation in an activity, that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information on users under the age of 13 without parental consent. If you are under 13, please do not email us, contact our website, attempt to use our website, submit information to our website, or ask us to email you. If you are under the age of 18, you should get permission from a parent or guardian before you email our website, contact our website, attempt to use our website, submit information to our website or ask us to email you.   Links To / From Other Sites  Our website contains links to other Internet websites which we do not operate and, conversely, other Internet websites may contain links to our website. We are not aware of and are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of such other websites. We encourage visitors to read and become familiar with the privacy policies maintained by such other websites.   Opt-Out  A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computers hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. We use cookies on certain pages of our site. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Among other reasons why we use cookies, cookies allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. If you do not desire the functionality created by cookies, you have the option to disable that function. To disable the cookie function, you may disable the function on your browser. Note that some site features may not function if cookies are disabled.   Security  The Company uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as data encryption, firewalls, system security measures and Secure Socket Layers (SSL). Please be advised that perfect security does not exist in commercial Internet applications and that such security measures may not prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of information on our websites. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. The registration pages, where you enter your personal and credit card information, are secure. This means that any information you send us is protected by encryption. Additionally, anytime we ask for your credit card number, we transmit that number using SSL encryption. It is easy to tell when you are protected by encryption your browser displays a lock or a key which is no longer broken or it changes color when you are on a secure page. The actual icon and its location may vary depending on your browser. For example, Internet Explorer has a Security padlock icon at the bottom right of the page, which appears closed when you have entered a secure page. Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your Flash Seats password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.If you have any questions related to this policy, please email the Flash Seats Privacy Officer at privacy@flashseats.com.   ) () () (Continue)

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took to Twitter to cite Georgia state law’s prohibition against “theft by extortion.”  “Troubling. I assume CNN's lawyers are examining GA § 16-8-16 Theft by extortion. If CNN constructively obtained the gif-maker's IP...it's a GA crime if they threatened to ‘Disseminate any information tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule....’” he wrote, citing a portion of the statute.  WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange also claimed on Twitter that CNN may have violated various state and federal laws related to “coercion” and the First Amendment.  CNN, however, has adamantly defended its handling of the story, issuing a statement Wednesday saying the network did not publish the user’s name out of concern for his safety -- adding, "Any assertion that the network blackmailed or coerced him is false."   In the statement, CNN said the team published the line in question to be “transparent that there was no deal.”  Andrew Kaczynski, the senior editor and founding member of the cable network's KFile investigative team, tweeted several defenses of the article, saying parts were “being misinterpreted.”  Related Image   Expand / Collapse  Andrew Kaczynski is a senior editor and founding member of CNN's KFile investigative team.  The Reddit user in question was behind the controversial GIF that President Trump tweeted out Sunday -- and that showed Trump wrestling an opponent (from his pre-politician days) with a CNN logo plastered over his face. The KFile group found the creator -- user name “HanA**holeSolo” -- by comparing information posted on Reddit to Facebook profiles. While CNN decided against publishing the user's real name, the network appeared to attach a caveat to that decision.  “CNN is not publishing ‘HanA**holeSolo’s’ name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again,” the article stated. “…CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.”  Further, CNN’s initial Tuesday tweet about the article implied the Reddit user only apologized once he was contacted by the KFile.  “Exclusive: CNN tracked down the Reddit user behind the Trump wrestling GIF. Now he’s apologizing,” the tweet said.   Kaczynski defended his unit’s work.  “The line is being misinterpreted. It was intended only to mean we made no agreement w/the man about his identity,” he wrote, adding at one point: “CNN specifically chose not to reveal this guy’s identity and to say we threatened anyone is a total lie.”  Kaczynski also said the Reddit user had been made aware of the ongoing Internet kerfuffle and had gotten in touch with him again.  “FYI ‘HanA**holeSolo’ just called me. ‘I am in total agreement with your statement. I was not threatened in any way,’" Kaczynski wrote.  Kaczynski initially said the user “posted his apology before we *ever* spoke” to him, calling KFile afterwards to apologize again. But after further questions, Kaczynski said the initial apology didn’t come until CNN had contacted the user and asked to talk to him.  He also justified his article by noting a previous instance of the Reddit user’s work, which was anti-Semitic: “This was someone who shared an image of CNN reporters’ face with Stars of David next them.”  But the article caveat nevertheless drew criticism.   Many were shocked by the perceived threat of “doxing” – publicly sharing private details about a person.   German Lopez, a reporter for left-leaning Vox, tweeted: “I can’t emphasize how bad this is on CNN’s part. This is basically ‘don’t post stuff we don’t like or we’ll dox you.’ Extremely unethical.”  WikiLeaks tweeted, "Trump was bad. CNN is worse: CNN threatens amateur satirist behind Trump video: make fun of us again and we dox you."   Fox News’ Cody Derespina contributed to this report.)

A total of 67 officers have died so far this year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It found there were 57 officer deaths between January 1 and July 5, 2016. In addition, gun-related deaths have risen by 9 percent, from 22 to 24 for 2017, the researchers say.  The figures suggest a grim trend; 2016 was the deadliest year for police in 5 years. A total of 135 officers died last year.  New York Police Department Officer Miosotis Familia was “assassinated” during an “unprovoked attack,” according to NYPD commissioner James O’Neill. Familia was sitting in her marked vehicle early Wednesday when a man shot at her through the window.   Related Image   Expand / Collapse  Chicago Police Department file photo. (AP Photo/Paul Beaty)  Randy Sutton, national spokesman for Blue Lives Matter and a retired Las Vegas police lieutenant, said that Familia’s killing is a symptom of the growing violence against law enforcement.  NEW YORK CITY COP 'ASSASSINATED' IN THE BRONX  “People now are more willing to engage the police in combat,” Sutton told Fox News. “Last year approximately 50,000 law enforcement officers were assaulted, that ran the gamut from pushing them to shooting them and causing disabling injuries.”  "Part of the war on cops [is] the failure of police leadership to step up to the place and not acquiesce to political considerations when it comes to the safety of police officers,” Sutton said. “The other part of the war on cops is the failure of the media to post anything positive about police. All they do is put up damaging stories and spin much of that into a narrative that is false and perpetuates a distorted narrative.”  Familia is the seventh New York Police Officer to die this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. Its founder, Chris Cosgriff, said: “When a police officer is killed, it’s not an agency that loses an officer, it’s an entire nation.”      Both the ODMP and NLEOMF track officer deaths and report on trends and increases or decreases in types of officer fatalities over the years.  "It's really hard to put a finger on any specific cause," ODMP Research Director Steve Weiss told Fox News. Weiss said the numbers fluctuate, and "go up and down year to year."  However, "In 1997 at this time, 33 officers had been killed," Weiss said. "There's been a steady decrease over the years and I imagine a lot of that has to do with beter technology, better training."  Weiss added, "The goal is to get deaths per year under 100."   The ODMP also offers resources to help prevent officer fatalities. Weiss described the "No Parole for Cop Killers" program which notifies people when a cop killer is up for parol, their partnership with the Armor of God project, which "provides bullet resistant vests to members of all organizations who are not able to receive them" and a partnership that creates officer awareness posters, and reminds officers to wear their seatbelts and bulletproof vests.   BRONX SHOOTING: SAN ANTONIO POLICE CHIEF SAYS ATTACKS AGAINST COPS 'ALL TOO COMMON'  Also killed on July 4 this year was Police Officer Robert Johnson, of the Northville Police Department in New York. Johnson was struck by a vehicle and killed while driving home after he had gotten off duty. He noticed a crash between a deer and a vehicle and retrieved his service weapon and approached the scene. While walking down the shoulder to dispatch the deer he was struck by a second vehicle.   OFFICER FATALITIES GROW AS MONTANA DEPUTY IS KILLED ON DUTY  Johnson is one of hundreds of officers listed on the ODMP site. Weiss said, "The organization was started as a way to memoralize officers and raise public awareness of the number of officers that were killed each year."  He added, "People don't understand the sacrifices officers make. There are not too many professions where people are murdered while doing their job and this is one profession where people are killed somewhat routinely in performing their job."  Memorializing the fallen officers "gives family members a place to come to remember their loved ones," Weiss said.  Fox News' Elizabeth Llorente contributed to this report.)

New photo may reveal she was captured by Japanese) (The disappearance of Amelia Earhart is one of the great unsolved mysteries, although a recently-discovered photo is being touted as a vital clue to the aviation pioneer’s fate.  Earhart, who was attempting to fly around the world, disappeared on July 2, 1937 during a flight from Papua New Guinea to Howland Island in the Pacific. Researchers claim that new evidence from U.S. Government archives may finally solve the mystery of what happened to the record-breaking pilot.  A two-hour documentary “Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence” will reveal the documents when it airs on the History channel July 9.  Investigators will present the theory that Earhart survived her final flight after crash-landing in the Marshall Islands. The aviator, they say, was then captured by the Japanese military and died in their custody on the island of Saipan. The investigators also claim that the U.S. government may have covered up Earhart’s fate, citing the possibility that she was on a spying mission.  NEW SEARCH WILL LOOK FOR AMELIA EARHART’S BONES  The Japanese government has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from Fox News.  Related Image   Expand / Collapse  A closeup of the image (Photograph courtesy of Les Kinney/U.S. National Archives)  A photograph, which purportedly shows Earhart, her navigator Fred Noonan and their ill-fated plane after the crash, is presented as a critical piece of evidence in the documentary. The photo was found within the U.S. National Archives by Les Kinney, a former U.S. Treasury Agent. “The photograph came out of a Navy file, a formerly top secret file in the National Archives,” says Kinney, during the documentary. “It was misfiled and that was the only reason I found it.”  The photo of a group of people on a Marshall Islands dock shows Earhart sitting with her back to the camera, according to Kinney. “Look at the body, the build, the short hair, the fact that she’s Caucasian,” he explained, adding that the tall man on the left of the group is Noonan.  NEW EVIDENCE REPORTEDLY INDICATES AMELIA EARHART SURVIVED CRASH  Earhart’s plane is said to be on a barge in the far right of the picture, which was tested with recognition and proportional comparison technology.  Related Image   Expand / Collapse  A closeup of the image - researchers say that the man on the left is Fred Noonan (Photograph courtesy of Les Kinney/U.S. National Archives)  The documentary also focuses on plane parts found on Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands that are said to be consistent with the aircraft Earhart was flying in 1937.  However, Dorothy Cochrane, curator in the Aeronautics department of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum told Fox News there is no evidence that Earhart was sent out on a spying mission. Cochrane, who has not yet seen the new documentary says that unravelling the Earhart mystery remains incredibly difficult. “There’s no definite evidence that anyone has got as to where she ended up,” she said.  The first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, Earhart was one of the most famous people at the time of her disappearance. A number of theories have emerged about her fate.  AMELIA EARHART'S PLANE DISCOVERED ... IN OLD MOVIE  One theory is that Earhart died a castaway after landing her plane on the remote island of Nikumaroro, a coral atoll some 1,200 miles from the Marshall Islands.  Some 13 human bones were found on Nikumaroro, which is also known as Gardner Island, three years after Earhart’s disappearance. The bones, however, were subsequently lost.  A new search for other bones on the island was recently launched.  The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Related Image   Expand / Collapse  NYPD officer Miosotis Familia.  (Facebook)  Miosotis Familia, 48, died at a hospital early Wednesday, and her suspected shooter died during a separate confrontation with police, who encountered the man running a few blocks away. An uninvolved bystander was shot in the stomach during that incident, but was in stable condition at a hospital, The New York Post reported.  Related Image   Expand / Collapse  The gunman was identified as 34-year-old Alexander Bonds.  (NYPD)  "Let's be clear: This was nothing less than an assassination of a police officer," a source told The New York Daily News. "Our understanding is she was filling out her memo book and he walked out and fired one round."  Officials said the attack unfolded in the Bronx just after 12:30 a.m. while Familia was sitting in her vehicle with her partner. Her partner radioed for help while other officers spotted the suspect, identified as 34-year-old Alexander Bonds, and began chasing him.  Related Image   Expand / Collapse  An NYPD vehicle with a cracked window sits on the scene where a police officer was fatally shot in the Bronx section of New York, July 5, 2017.  (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  Bonds drew his silver revolver on police before they began shooting, investigators said.  Bonds was on parole for a 2014 robbery in Syracuse. He had up to six different aliases and had recently posted content critical of law enforcement officers on social media, a source told The Daily News.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  Officials were so far unaware of any connection between Bonds and Familia, a 12-year NYPD veteran and mother of three.  "Fully knowing the dangers that she faced, she suited up in uniform every day and stood tall against those who threaten and terrorize the good folks of the Bronx. As we mourn her death and support her family, friends and colleagues, we ask for your help," Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said. "When you see or hear someone making threats against NYC police officers you need to let us know, you need to be our eyes and ears."       Familia "was on duty, serving this city protecting people, doing what she believed in and the job she loved," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. "After this shocking and sudden attack, her fellow officers came to her aid immediately."  "This horrific and senseless assassination is a devastating reminder of the risks these brave men and women face each day," Gov. Andrew Cuomo added.

The U.S. had watched North Korea fueling the rocket prior to launch, the official said.  Related Image   Expand / Collapse  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects the preparations for an intercontinental ballistic missile flight.  (KCNA via AP)  "Clearly we watch North Korea very closely," Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said.  The missile fired on Tuesday is a new type of North Korean ICBM, which has yet to be named. It uses liquid fuel – meaning the rocket takes more time to move and is less mobile than a missile that operates on solid fuel.  "Not one we have seen before," Davis said, adding the missile lifted off from an aircraft plant near Panghyon -- a location North Korea hadn't previously used for a launch.  Related Image   Expand / Collapse  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watches the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.  (KRT via AP)  The ICBM was delivered to the launch site on a mobile flat-bed truck, but not launched from it. The distinction is important because a mobile-launcher is very difficult to detect and defend against.  Given the apparent advance notice enjoyed by U.S. officials, the Pentagon could have decided to try to shoot the ICBM down using the U.S. missile defense shield components in the region.      But because the missile wasn't a threat to North America, the U.S. declined to attempt to terminate the rocket, which flew 1,700 miles into space and was in flight for 37 minutes.  "Longest time of flight for any ballistic missile North Korea has launched to date," Davis said.  Even though the U.S. homeland may never have been in danger, however, there was plenty of peril posed by the North Korean ICBM.  U.S. and Japanese bases in Japan were well within range of the missile, and a Department of Defense official said it also flew "into busy airspace used by commercial airlines" and endangered shipping in the Sea of Japan because North Korea didn't coordinate the launch with any other countries.

And while Trump believes a wall will thwart illegal immigrants and drug dealers, it will do little to address the daunting labyrinth law enforcement authorities are confronting below the ground, a challenge that officials say they are ill-equipped to address.  There are at least 180 cross-border tunnels and intricate drainage systems between Mexico and California and Arizona, according to the Border Patrol, and drug dealers and human traffickers, known as coyotes, use these tunnels to move drugs and illegally smuggle people across the border largely undetected. As the number of tunnels grow and become more sophisticated, Border Patrol agents say they are falling behind in finding technology that will detect them.  MEXICO'S UNFILLED BORDER TUNNELS A SECURITY RISK, US OFFICIALS SAY  Lance Lenoir, a member of the Border Patrol elite tunnel team working out of the San Diego Sector, said his team of five agents patrol the daunting miles of storm drains that lead them to connecting tunnels along the border.   slideshow  “They are always digging tunnels somewhere," Lenoir said.  Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical analysis for Stratfor, a geopolitical intelligence firm based out of Austin, Texas, said Mexican drug dealers are shelling out millions of dollars to build underground tunnels into the U.S. And very few people, he said, know about their existence. Some of these tunnels have rail systems, lighting, ventilation and hydraulic lifts.  UNEARTHED: 2 TUNNELS LEADING INTO CALIFORNIA FROM MEXICO FOUND  “In order to ensure a good return on this huge investment, the cartel groups work to keep the tunnel’s existence and the locations of its exits a secret,” Stewart said. “In fact, we have seen cases in which cartels have brought laborers in to dig tunnels and then killed them after they were done to keep the tunnel secret.”  He said those who do know about the tunnel are highly trusted employees and “very few in numbers to ensure solid operational security.”  The tunnels that are discovered are usually found by Border Patrol tunnel specialists or by accident during narcotics surveillance operations.  One recent tunnel discovered in October 2016 ran 330 yards from an ice store near the Tijuana airport to a store just across the border in the U.S. Officials said about 5 tons of marijuana was found in the tunnel and in the buildings on both sides of the border. The tunnels were found because of an anonymous tip – not because of detecting equipment, Lenoir said.  Lenoir said technology, such as ground-penetrating radar, does exist. But not only is it ineffective in many areas along the border, it is not available to enough agents to make a major impact.  And criminals are exploiting the weaknesses in detection technology.  “Unfortunately, we are severely lacking in technology,” he said, referring to the number of field agents available and the quality of the existing equipment to reliably detect a tunnel. “It’s difficult trying to find something in a specific geologic region that is in a confined space that can be 4 feet in diameter and 90 feet underground.”  Limiting the available technology: Surface noise. The noise from nearby traffic and major freeways and unregulated radio traffic from Mexico impairs an agent’s ability to detect what’s happening below ground.  “We’re aggressively pursuing better technology and interdiction strategies,” Lenoir said, “but it also has to come down to political will.”  Joseph J.
